When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories would be used if your usual, local machine is unavailable, or if you 
are working with another individual.  It would allow sharing information.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic pulls may result in changes that you did not want.  Since the repository is public,
anyone can add changes. You may want to make informed decisions about what updates to your remote
repository that you want in your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - a copy on another repository made directly on the GitHub server
Clone - a copy of a repository made on your local machine
Branch - a specific commit history path within a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This allows us to be able to investigate conflicts and merge to reflect all commits we desire.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Email, shared directory, dropbox, etc.  It may be more difficult to time/track the changes and comments.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You would want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master, if you are collaborating
and need to confirm changes with others.  This allows the master to remain in tact, while providing a way to 
communicate forthcoming changes.
