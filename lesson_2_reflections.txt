What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new repository is created in the directory.  At this point, the repository is considered empty and there
has been no initial commit.  The files will need to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds file that are set to be committed.  Files will still be contained in the working directory.
Even if the files are removed from the staging area, they will exist in the working directory.  Files that have
been committed will become part of the repository.  I believe the staging area allows a space to organize files that 
may be added to a repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can make sure to only add relevant files to the staging area.  If files are there
that should not part of the logical change, you can use "git reset" to remove them.
